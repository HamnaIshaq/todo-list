# Todo list logic and steps to build logic

- a todo list to track our tasks

- a project hosts multiple todos
- a project todos are seperate from another todos

features included

- view all projects
- view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedateâ€¦ perhaps changing color for different priorities)
- expand a single todo to see/edit its details
- delete a todo

approach

main logic

- Project class

  - id : num / uuid
  - projectName : str
  - TodoList : arr of objects

- Todo class
  - id : num / uuid
  - title: str
  - description: str
  - dueDate: str (from a calendar)
  - priority: num (from a select dropdown --> 1-high, 2-medium, 3-low)
  - completed: bool

Steps
1- UI for application ([DONE])
2- Show a default project called "inbox" on page load with some dummy data ([DONE])
3- Create a new todo and show it in dummy inbox project
1- get user data for todo
1- create a modal

- for 1 project
  1- create a project ([])

  3- create a new todo ([])
  4- edit a todo ([])
  5- delete a todo ([])
  6- view details of a todo ([])
